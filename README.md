Web client of the [Tradity](https://tradity.de/) stock trading game

## About
This is the client code of Germany’s largest stock trading game with a focus on “Social Trading”,
targeted at students and combining an educational resource on economics and stock trading with
a challenging online game.

You can find out more about the game and register at https://tradity.de/ (of course, it’s free to play).

## Documentation
Documentation of the client code is mostly in a “work in progress” state; However, there are
quite complete docs on the client/server protocol available, which we will make public in the
(hopefully very) near future.

## Contributing
Pull requests & issue reports are highly welcome! You can contact us about anything
